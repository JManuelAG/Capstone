    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "- pandas: Data manipulation library in Python.\n",
    "- numpy: Numerical computing library in Python.\n",
    "- os: Operating system interface for file operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Steps Performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading Data**: \n",
    "   - The script loads tweet and user data from CSV files located in subdirectories of the base directory specified as `base_directory`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Selection**:\n",
    "   - Selects relevant features from both tweet and user datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Type Conversion**:\n",
    "   - Converts the 'created_at' column in the users dataset to datetime format.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handling Missing Values**:\n",
    "   - Fills missing values with zeros for numeric columns in both tweet and user datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "   - Calculates additional features such as 'account_age_years', 'followers_to_friends_ratio' in the users dataset.\n",
    "   - Calculates tweet-level features such as 'retweet_ratio' and 'reply_ratio'.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Normalization**:\n",
    "   - Scales numeric features in both tweet and user datasets to a range between 0 and 1 using Min-Max scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Data Merging**:\n",
    "   - Merges the tweet and user datasets on the 'user_id' and 'id' columns respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Bot Labeling**:\n",
    "   - Adds a binary 'bot' label based on the folder name.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Saving Cleaned Data**:\n",
    "   - Saves the cleaned and processed dataframes as CSV files in a 'clean' subdirectory within each dataset's folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returns:\n",
    "- None. The method adjusts the DataFrame in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling\n",
    "- **FileNotFoundError**: This error may occur if the base directory does not exist or is incorrect. Ensure the directory path is correct and accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DataError**: If there are issues in data consistency such as missing columns needed for selected features, the method will raise this error.\n",
