# TwiTwitter Bot Detection 

Welcome to the TwiTwitter Bot Detection! This project provides a comprehensive framework for data import, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation using Python. It includes various modules for different stages of the machine learning pipeline, such as importing data, cleaning, splitting, modeling, and evaluating machine learning models.

## What the Project Does

This project offers the following functionalities:

- **Data Import and Preprocessing:**
  - *Importing Data:* The project provides utilities to import data from CSV files into pandas DataFrames.
  - *Cleaning and Preprocessing:* There are modules to preprocess and clean datasets, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

- **Data Splitting:**
  - The project allows for splitting datasets into training, testing, and validation sets with customizable proportions.

- **Modeling:**
  - Users can train various machine learning models using scikit-learn, such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.
  - Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are supported for optimizing model performance.

- **Evaluation:**
  - The project provides tools for evaluating model performance using a range of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC-ROC, and Matthews correlation coefficient.
  - Visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves are generated to aid in understanding model behavior.
